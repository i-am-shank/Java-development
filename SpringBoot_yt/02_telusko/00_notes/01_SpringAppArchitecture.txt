Client   <-->   layers   <-->   DB

layers (CSR)  :  (Client-side to DB-side)
  1. Controller  =>  interacts with client-request
  2. Service  =>  do any business logic
  3. Repository  =>  connect the database

All 3-layers are classes.



In following OOPs, if we want to work with service inside controller class, then we have to create an object of that service inside controller class.
Same thing applies for Service & Repository.
