Unit testing
	->  It is a way to test the smallest part of the code, such as individual methods or classes, to ensure they work as expected

Why Unit testing ? 
	->  Fast feedback
	->  Early bug detection
	->  Easier to maintain
	->  Increases confidence

Application
	->  Controllers
	  ->  ControllerTest
	->  Services
	  ->  ServiceTest
	->  Repos
	  ->  RepoTest

Code-coverage of unit tests :
	->  How much of the code is covered in unit tests is called Code-coverage. This is analysed by some tools like Sonar, etc.
