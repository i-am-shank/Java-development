Spring boot by default has imported :- 
	->  junit
	->  mockito

@Test - annotation
	->  comes from org.junit.jupiter.api


@Mock - annotation
	->  helps to create a mock-object (of service/repository), instead of them being null
	->  But for that, the test class should extend MockitoExtension class.

@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
	->  This annotation is needed for the test class, to make @Mock create mock-objects successfully.
	->  Without this, even with @Mock annotation, the object will remain uninitialised.

@InjectMocks - annotation
	->  Added to objects which need some another @Mock - object as dependency to be injected to them.
	->  If @Mock is used instead of this, that dependency injection won't happen
