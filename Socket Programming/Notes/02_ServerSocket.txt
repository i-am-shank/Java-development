ServerSocket : 
  ----> We will have a socket at client-side initially. And, initially there will be no socket at Server-end. It has a ServerSocket.
  ----> Job of ServerSocket is to wait for incoming client-connections requests.
  ----> So, socket over client-side will send a connection request to server. And, ServerSocket will accept the request. After which, a socket object is created on server-side.
